Hello! This is a console app of the game 21.

I would like to list problems with the app that I KNOW of:


1. The app is very messy and doesn't contain comments where others might need or want to know whats going on.
2. The code does NOT use best practices and uses goto statements to jump around (kind of speghetti code but not entirely if you read it.)

   Any other problems with the code a DM or email to 0xF11@riseup.net would be appreciated!
